## Installation
The development version of treesurgeon is available on [Github](https://github.com/evo-palaeo/treesurgeon). I aim to make the package availible on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) in the near future. To install treesurgeon from Github, use the `install_github()` function in the `devtools` package:

```
if (!require(remotes)){
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("evo-palaeo/treesurgeon")
```
